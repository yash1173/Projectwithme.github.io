            <p class="text">
            The name pune was derived form the word 'Punya' which 
            means the confluence of two rivers as it is situated on
            the banks of river muthi and river mula. The city was also named Punaka Desha, Ounevadi, 
            kasba pune, poona and so on before it came to be known as Pune, officially, aftert 1978.
            </p>
            <p class ="text">
              pune is a city that was the epicentre of chhatrapati Shivaji's empire. 
              It makes the city's history loaded with rich culture and heritage. The Maratha 
              culture is extremely prominent in Pune, more than any other place in Maharastra.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              Pune come into recognition after it was under Maratha rule. Although the Maratha rule started in
              the early 1600s, the power kept on shifting between the Mughals, the Bhosale, and the Adil Shaho Dynastya
              till the 17th century.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              In 1625, Shahji Bhosale, who was the father of Shivaji Maharaj (the founder of the Maratha Empire), began the 
              construction of the Lal Mahal as his wife Jijabai and son were about to move there. The construction was completed 
              in 1640 and Shivaji Maharaj stayed there for almost a decade.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              After Shivajiâ€™s death, Peshwas ruled the city and made several advancements to it. However, in 1761, after the 3rd battle
               of Panipat, the influence of Peshwas started declining and one fine day, Pune came under the power of the Britishers.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              Once the Britishers took over their control, they established the administration in this region. Slowly and steadily,
              several things were designed in Pune and gradually, it gained recognition from people belonging to different regions
              from all over the world.
